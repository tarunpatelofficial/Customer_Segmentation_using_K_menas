# Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using unsupervised machine learning techniques, primarily **K-Means Clustering**. It aims to group customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic data, helping businesses understand their target audience more effectively.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` – Main notebook with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and visualization.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
- K-Means clustering implementation
- Cluster visualization using scatter plots

## 📊 Results

The clustering analysis provides distinct customer groups based on their features (e.g., spending scores, annual income), allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
